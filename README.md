Modern UI/UX websites with React

The goal of this project was to build a responsive website using ReactJS. The Figma design was given as a template and I was able to practice transferring the Figma
design to a functional and responsive site. 

I did have to troubleshoot grids and image placement that were not correct compared to the image. I also was introduced to and have tried to continue to use CSS BEM model.
